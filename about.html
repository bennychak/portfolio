			<h4>Self-Introduce</h4>

			<p>My name is Zhai Dongfang, born in 1985, now live in Beijing. I’m an interaction designer in DidiChuxing – a company which focus on car sharing via mobile devices and big data.</p>

			<p>Before 21 years old, I lived in Zhengzhou, a medium-sized city in Henan Province. I read a lot of Chinese contemporary literature works during my high school life, thus literature and reading have become my favourite hobby since then. After graduation from high school, I entered Zhengzhou University of Light Industry to study software engineering.</p>

			<p>As a graduate from there, I applied a certification assistant job in CCIC Corporation Henan Department, then worked in Zhengzhou for 2 years until 2008. I went to Beijing independently at the time for the reason of Olympic. It seems like a challenge, and very soon a exhibition company hired me because of that my writing skill and the experience of web design were what they needed. I became a web editor then, my responsibilities were to edit articles online and design promotion webpages for their vertical portal website which served for the exhibition industry. After 1 year later, I had already taken the position of project manager there. However, I jumped once again. With the experience of web design and content management, I went to another company which had a big plan to create a social network platform. It was so called Web 2.0 mode, I played my role as a still web designer there for 1 year. In 2011, I started my interaction designer life in Tencent. In next 4 years, I used to design many features of different products. For example, Tencent Weibo (http://t.qq.com, twitter-liked microblogging service), Weishi (http://weishi.qq.com, vine-liked short video sharing platform), Tencent News Client (news service in mobile era) etc., including information architecture and functional design. In 2015, DidiChuxing became a phenomenon of internet economic, I received an invitation from that company and continued another career journey. </p>

			<p>Those above are about my career. In recent years, there have been dozens of changes in online media industry. The more I know about design, The less I know about content. So I think I should back to media, literature and language themselves and learn more about those fundamentals.</p>

			<p>On the other hand, in 2008 – 2013, I finished my self-taught mode study in the major of Chinese Language & Literature which was provided by Beijing Normal University. Finally, I gained my Bachelor of Arts degree through the defense and won the outstanding thesis award. In 2014, I redesigned international official website of PKU. In the following year, I translated two books into Chinese (Stephen A. Thomas' “Data Visualization with JavaScript” and Aaron Gustafson's “Adaptive Web Design”). Both of them are in the publishing process. In addition, I have kept in touch with some influential oversea designers as @Brad_Frost, @LukeW, @Grigs, we track each other on LinkedIn or Instagram and discuss design issues.</p>
